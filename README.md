This is a sandbox project where I attempt to recreate the logic of [Balatro](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2379780/Balatro/).
Balatro is a roguelike deck-building video game developed by LocalThunk and published by Playstack.
The purpose of this project is mostly to familiarize myself with the Rust programming language while having fun.
